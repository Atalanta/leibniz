# Things to do on Leibniz

- High level documentation
- Remove some nasty magic numbers
- On a physical box, prove that we can run a Leibniz job from Jenkins
- Try to get Leibniz to with TK to with the EC2 driver (or LXC / Docker)
- Demonstrate that this can work with Librarian?
- Demonstrate (and document) how to make Leibniz use the chef-zero provisioner
- Provide a generator which creates the outline stuff
- It'd be nice to be able to run the cucumber test and skip the teardown and setup process
